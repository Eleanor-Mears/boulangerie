                            <p>Eleanor’s promising career as a gourmand was cut short when she developed an intolerance
                                to gluten. Despairing of the dry, insipid gluten-free breads available, she stumbled
                                upon sourdough bread. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more1"> While not completely gluten-free, the natural leaven of a
                                sourdough loaf is much more easily digested. To Eleanor’s delight, she discovered that
                                sourdough bread also just happens to be some of the most delicious bread available and
                                making it went from hobby to obsession. Friends and family loved her breads and Eleanor
                                began to dream about owning her own sourdough bakery. The rest is history.</span></p>
